# JoelKellyca3

This project is a small system that is used to add, view, update and delete vehicles from a database and also to add reviews for these vehicles.

## Getting Started

The first thing to do for this project setup is to create a database called wp_ca3_kelly_joel and paste what is in the wp_ca3_kelly_joel.sql file into this database.
This should give you the correct tables needed for this project including the vehicles, categories and reviews tables. Once this is done you are ready to use the system.
You should then go to https://github.com/jKelly1999/JoelKellyca3 and pull the files down to gain acccess to the project. Create a project on your system and call it wp_ca3_kelly_joel
and put these files onto the project. You should now be able to run the project and it should be fully functional.

## Testing
There is a few things you can do to test if this project is working. You should add a vehicle to the databse using the vehicle manager page and then edit this vehicle,
go to the database on your system and check the vehicles table to see if this worked. If it did you can then go back to the vehicle manager page and delete this vehicle.
Again go back to the vehicles table in your database and check if this worked. The final test you can do is go to the vehicle reviews page of the site and add a review.
Check if this worked by looking for the review in the reviews table of the database.
